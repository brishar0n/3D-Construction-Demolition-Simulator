# 3D Construction Demolition Simulator ðŸ§±

### Overview

##### Our proposed solution for the construction and deconstruction simulation project involves developing a robust computational 3D interactive model that accurately simulates the processes involved in both constructing and deconstructing various structures. 

##### This model will utilize principles from computational physics to simulate the interactions between different materials, forces and structural factors.

### Features
- Different block materials
- Destruction can be simple as dropping heavy balls (drops in where the user clicks) on the structures or explosions

### Installation
- panda3d | `pip install panda3d
`
- Python (if haven't installed yet)

### Controls
#### Camera Movement
##### W: Move forward
##### S: Move backward
##### A: Move left
##### D: Move right
##### Mouse Movement: Look around

#### Block Interaction
##### Mouse Click (Left Button): Add a block at the clicked location
##### Block Size Slider: Adjust the size of the blocks to be placed
