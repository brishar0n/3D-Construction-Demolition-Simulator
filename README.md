# 3D Construction Demolition Simulator ðŸ§±

### Overview

##### Our proposed solution for the construction and deconstruction simulation project involves developing a robust computational 3D interactive model that accurately simulates the processes involved in both constructing and deconstructing various structures. 

##### This model will utilize principles from computational physics to simulate the interactions between **different materials, forces and structural factors.**

### Features
- Different block materials
- Different block shapes and sizes
- Distinct demolition methods like explosions, wrecking ball, earthquake and dropping a ball

### Installation
- panda3d | `pip install panda3d`
- Python (if haven't installed yet)

### Controls
#### Camera Movement:
##### W - Move forward
##### S - Move backward
##### A - Move left
##### D - Move right
##### Mouse Movement - Look around

#### Block Interaction:
##### Mouse Click (Left Button) - Add a block at the clicked location
##### Block Size Slider - Adjust the size of the blocks to be placed
